MY PURPOSE IN RE-CREATING THE INSTAGRAM PAGE IS TO BRING IMAGES AND MESSAGES OF FAITH AND HOPE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. LIKE ME THAT I LOST MY FATHER AT THE AGE OF 70, ON THE 27TH OF MAY 2021... I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IN FAITH IN GOD THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NEW TOMORROW...
